Write entropy program:
- python code --> careful with multiline comments in python and c++

Theory, keylogger based on:
- hooks-based
- winAPI Get(Async)KeyState or GetKeyboardState
- kernel-based

Low level c++ payloads:
- write payload for windows
- random variable to change the hash

High level payloads cross platforms (pynput is hook-based SetWindowsHookExA):
- from python to exe

Obfuscation:
- base64, hex, bytes, encrypt the payload
- multi-staged payload

Results:
- Defender Python: 
    - payload0: No
    - payload1: No
    - payload2: Yes
    - payload3: No
    - payload4: Yes
