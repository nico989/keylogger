Write entropy program:
- python code --> add for loop random

Theory, keylogger based on:
- hooks-based
- winAPI Get(Async)KeyState or GetKeyboardState
- kernel-based

Low level c++ payloads:
- write payload for windows

High level payloads cross platforms (pynput is hook-based SetWindowsHookExA):
- from python to exe

Obfuscation:
- change hash, base64, hex, bytes, encryption --> create EXE
- multi-staged payload

Results:
- Defender Python: 
    - payload0: No
    - payload1: No
    - payload2: Yes
    - payload3: No
    - payload4: Yes
